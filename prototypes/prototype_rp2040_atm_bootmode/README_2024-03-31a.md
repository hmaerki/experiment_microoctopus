# rp2040 ATM, Bootmode


It would be beneficial, if this rp2040 may be reflashed without having to manually press the bootsel button.

## Terms

From `picotool`:
* BOOTSEL mode
* application mode
* application mode but running compatible code


## Concept

### Poweron

* RP2040 must boot in BOOTSEL mode
  * Rationale 1: The flash is empty
  * Rationale 2: The BOOTSEL-button is pressed

* Flashing micropython

   `sudo ./picotool load  /home/maerki/Downloads/RPI_PICO-20240126-v1.23.0-preview.72.g4a2e510a8.uf2`

* Reboot into application mode

   `sudo ./picotool reboot --application`

   or

   `usb reset`

   Important: Now the BOOTSEL-button must be depressed


## Requirements for the BOOTSEL button

The BOOTSEL button must be pressed during 500m after power up.

A jumper allows to switch to this mode: BOOTSEL button is never pressed.

METHOD #1
--------------------

Half as many cables as SWD approach and no software other than UF2 file to flash but needs cap on TP6.
``` 

Capacitor: 100nF vs 10kOhm -> 1ms

## Assessment

| App Boot | BOOTSEL Boot | Comment |
| - | - | - |
| Con (2 FET, 1 cap) | Pro (1 cap) | Simple electronics
| Pro | Con (will never appboot without picotool) | Behaviour as any micropython board
| Pro | Con (Board will ALWAYS mount a drive after powering on) |
| Con (Long sequenze for micropython flashing: Boot, reboot, flash, reboot, micropython) | Pro (always the same sequce (powerup, optional flash, reboot, micropython)) | Programming sequence |

## Capacitor

Required time 200ms

Sequence:
* USB command to power on the usb hub
* Wait till BOOTSEL is visible via USB
* `picotool reboot --application`

Above sequence will take at least 200ms.

Try with 10uF, 16V. Package 1210
 * USD0.01 C15850, Package 0805
