* USB Connector DUT: Vertical takes too much height: Vertical!
* Octobus: Pins 5/6 should not be connected!
* PCB: GPIO12 exists twice on silkscreen: Should be GPIO11

Pad for relay is too small.
Pad on octobus has to be bigger for manual soldering iron.


Relay Vorwiderstand: 3k9 / 390. Schema: (3.3V-1.25V)/5mA=409Ohm

Octobus: switch 1 and 2: Do NOT mirror!
Octobus: white dot on both sides (possibly 1, 2, 40)
